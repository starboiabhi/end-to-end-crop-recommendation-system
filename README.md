# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to predict the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and environmental conditions. The system uses various features such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide accurate recommendations.

## Features

- Predict the best crop for given soil and environmental conditions
- User-friendly interface for inputting data and viewing recommendations
- Supports multiple crops and diverse geographical regions

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rohit-katkar2003/crop-recommendation-system.git
    cd crop-recommendation-system
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the crop recommendation script:**
    ```bash
    python crop.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the system:**
   - Input the required features (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
   - Get the recommended crop based on the input features.

## Dataset

The dataset (`Crop_recommendation.csv`) contains various features required for predicting the suitable crop. Each row represents a data point with the following columns:

- **N**: Nitrogen content in the soil
- **P**: Phosphorus content in the soil
- **K**: Potassium content in the soil
- **temperature**: Temperature of the environment
- **humidity**: Humidity of the environment
- **ph**: pH level of the soil
- **rainfall**: Rainfall amount
- **label**: Crop type (target variable)

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is saved in `app.sav`. The model is trained using a combination of various algorithms to ensure high accuracy in crop prediction.
